# CMFS Algorithm for feature selection

This is a python implementation of the CMFS algorithm for feature selection (paper included in the repository). Currently the implementation has only been completed on a toy dataset.

__TODO__:
  * Perform benchmark testing against Chi-square, IG feature selection algos on same dataset.
  
To contribute:
  * Fork this repo.
